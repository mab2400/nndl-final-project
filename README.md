# Neural Networks & Deep Learning Final Project Code

## To run the code:
- Upload the Jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb to Google Colab
- Ensure you are using a T4 GPU runtime
- Upload the contents of the directory "to_upload_to_colab" directly into the content/ 
  folder in Colab. (For example, /content/superclass_mapping.csv)
- Run the notebook, cell-by-cell, to create:
    - Models:
        - Baseline Model + Class-Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss
        - Baseline Model + Class-Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss + Fine-tuning from block6h onward
    - Metrics for the above models
    - Test predictions on the fine-tuned model
